# Text-Analytics

Using the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset and by learning Text Analytics from Data Sciecne Dojo youtube tutorials available at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8eNk_zTBST8olxIRFoo0YeXxEOkYdoxi, I have built classification model for classifying the input text as spam/ham. Also, I try few topic modelling techniques.
